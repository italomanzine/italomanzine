# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me

Hello! I'm Ítalo Manzine – a former Olympic swimmer turned Software Engineer with a passion for sports, technology, and software development. My athletic career taught me discipline, resilience, focus, and teamwork, qualities that I bring to every tech project I work on.

Since childhood, I have been driven by a natural curiosity to understand how things work. This curiosity led me to dive into the world of technology. Currently studying Computer Engineering at UFSC, I am deeply interested in software engineering and development. I am always eager to learn new technologies, refine my skills, and experiment with innovative ideas.

This GitHub profile showcases a range of projects that reflect my passion for technology. From software development to hardware experiments, my projects highlight both my technical abilities and my soft skills.

## Featured Projects

Here are some of the projects that best represent my work:

1. **Network Scanner ([View Project](https://github.com/italomanzine/network-scanner-tcp-udp))**  
   A network scanner for TCP and UDP sockets designed to discover the UDP port used by a JWT token receiving service. The project compares the behavior of different transport protocols and efficiently detects open ports. It's a robust tool for understanding network communications.

2. **ERP in C++ ([View Project](https://github.com/italomanzine/programmingLogic2/tree/main/Trabalho%20Final))**  
   A C++ ERP software with a graphical interface built in QT Creator. This project was developed to hone my object-oriented programming skills and demonstrates my ability to create comprehensive business solutions.

3. **Timing System ([View Project](https://github.com/italomanzine/timingSystem))**  
   An embedded system developed for organizing swimming competitions. The system integrates both hardware and software components to provide accurate timing and score management during events.

4. **Emergent Web Server Monitoring ([View Project](https://github.com/italomanzine/ews_project))**
   A Python script that monitors an Emergent Web Server (EWS) running in a Docker container, collecting metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, throughput, and response time. It applies algorithms to determine the optimal server configuration, with data saved in CSV files and visualization scripts provided.

*Additional noteworthy projects may be added as my work continues to evolve.*
